I speak without a mouth and fade without pain. I live only if someone calls my name. :: ECHO
I mark the start of every race and burn with sudden light, gone without a trace. :: FLASH
I’m cut to change your point of view, though I’m untouched when I cut you. :: ANGLE
I travel on wind, from blossom I rise; I carry new life in a tiny disguise. :: SPORE
I fall from the sky but I’m not rain; I blanket the earth in a soft white chain. :: SNOW
I show your path with steady gleam; sailors trust me in their dream. :: STAR
I open worlds but have no door; one look at me can make you soar. :: IMAGE
I break but make no sound, I fall but touch no ground. :: HEART
I live in your hand and on your screen, my bites aren't felt but still are seen. :: PIXEL
I turn without moving, I fly without wings, I reveal hidden things. :: LIGHT
