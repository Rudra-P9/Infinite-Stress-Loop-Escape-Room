  "story": {
    "intro": "“You wake up in a bright white room, the light dazing you. A voice echoes, shaky yet familiar `Hey. Easy now. My name`s Varen. You`re safe. We`re going to get you out of here.'",
    "roomOneIntro": "“A terminal flickers to life. Varen begins, 'This is a basic calibration to confirm your logic is intact.’”",
    "roomOneConc": "The console chimes softly. Varen sounds pleased: 'Good. Neural patterns are stabilizing. Let`s continue then.'",
    "roomTwoIntro": "You step into a corridor lined with broken screens and scattered data fragments floating in the air. Each fragment flashes with jumbled text. Varen`s tone softens: 'These are memory shards... pieces of what was once mine. Try to put them back together.'",
    "roomTwoBetween": "The screens pulse as the first fragment stabilizes. The floor shifts slightly beneath your feet, reorienting itself. Varen murmurs: 'Spatial mapping is unstable… we`ll need to recalibrate your movement pathways next.'",
    "roomTwoConc": "When the second puzzle finishes, the corridor lights flicker, then stabilize. Varen whispers: 'Memory alignment, seventy-five percent. You`re restoring more than just data. Shall we continue…?'",
    "roomThreeIntro": "Moving to the next room, you step into the core chamber. The lights dim to a soft pulse that syncs with your heartbeat. Varen speaks calmly: 'We`re nearing full synchronization. This test measures how our thoughts align, patterns, logic, precision. Solve it exactly as I would.'", 
    "roomThreeBetween": "As you complete the calculation, the console flickers. The number locks in perfectly, almost too perfect. The system hums in resonance with your pulse. Varen`s tone shifts, uncertain,  'That frequency… it`s echoing back. Something`s trying to communicate. Listen closely, it`s not me.'",
    "roomThreeConc": "Static floods the speakers. A voice overlays Varen`s own,  distorted, layered, identical voice. 'Subject 03 synchronization nearing completion.' The lights flicker as the chamber shakes. Varen`s voice breaks: 'It`s my voice… no… its yours. The system is waiting for the final command.'",
    "finalPuzzle": "The central terminal activates. Lines of code race across the glass. The prompt appears: 'ENTER MERGE COMMAND.' Varen pleads: 'Listen to me,  you execute it, we won`t come back.'",
    "conclusion": "You type REALM. The room floods with white light. The hum fades into silence, then darkness. You open your eyes in a sterile white room. A camera blinks red in the corner. An intercom crackles to life. You walk toward it, press the button, and speak `Hey. Easy now. My name`s Varen. You`re safe. We`re going to get you out of here."
