I speak without a mouth and fade without pain. I live only if someone calls my name. :: ECHO :: You hear it repeat after you in empty places.
I mark the start of every race and burn with sudden light, gone without a trace. :: FLASH :: It’s a quick burst of light.
I’m cut to change your point of view, though I’m untouched when I cut you. :: ANGLE :: you measure it when shapes or turns meet.
I fall from the sky but I’m not rain; I blanket the earth in a soft white chain. :: SNOW :: It falls in winter and covers everything in white.
I show your path with steady gleam; sailors trust me in their dream. :: STAR :: You see it shining in the night sky.
I open worlds but have no door; one look at me can make you soar. :: IMAGE :: It's another word for a picture.
I break but make no sound, I fall but touch no ground. :: HEART :: It beats inside you and symbolizes love.
I live in your hand and on your screen, my bites aren't felt but still are seen. :: PIXEL :: Tiny squares that make up a digital screen.
I turn without moving, I fly without wings, I reveal hidden things. :: LIGHT :: Without this, you'd be in the dark.
I'm the first to greet you in the morning and the last to leave you at night. :: SUN :: It provides warmth and light.
